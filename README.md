2. **Buffer Overflow:** here is a thorough explanation of implementing a buffer overflow using Linux Ubuntu 20.04.

3. **Cross-Site Scripting:** this is the solution for hacking a website using XSS.  If you're interested in the exercise, let me know, and I will provide you with the server and client code.

4. **Dirty Cow:** here is a full report on the dirty cow vulnerability, from how to execute it to the flaw allowing it to the patch applied.
